-- Covid 19 Data Exploration 
-- Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types


##Select data to start with

 SELECT 
   location,
   date,
   total_cases,
   new_cases,
   total_deaths,
   population
 FROM `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths` 
 Order by 
   location, 
   date



  ##Looking at Total Cases vs Total Deaths
  ##Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country
  
 SELECT 
   location,
   date,
   total_cases,
   total_deaths,
   (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as percent_of_deaths
 FROM `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths` 
 Where
   location like '%States%'
 Order by 
    location, 
   date


##Looking at total cases vs population
## Shows percentage of population that contracted covid

 SELECT 
   location,
   date,
   total_cases,
   population,
   (total_cases/population)*100 as percent_of_population
 FROM `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths` 
 Where
   location like '%States%'
 Order by 
   location, 
   date



##Looking at Countries with highest infection rate compared to population

 SELECT 
   location,
   population,
   max(total_cases) as Highest_infection_Count,
   max((total_cases/population)*100) as percent_of_population_infected
 FROM `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths`
 --Where
   --location like '%States%'
 Group by 
   location,
   population
 Order by 
   percent_of_population_infected DESC
 


##Showing Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

 SELECT 
   location,
   max(total_deaths) as Highest_Death_Count
  
 FROM `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths` 
 Where continent is not null ##removes locations that were listed as the continents
 Group by 
   location
 Order by 
   Highest_Death_Count DESC



##Breaking it down by continent

 SELECT 
   location,
   max(total_deaths) as Highest_Death_Count
  
 FROM `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths` 
 Where continent is null 
 Group by 
   location
 Order by 
   Highest_Death_Count DESC


##GLOBAL NUMBERS

 Select 
   SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, 
   SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, 
   SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage

 From `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths`
 --Where location like '%States%'
 where continent is not null 
 --Group By date
 order by total_cases,
   total_deaths



## Total Population vs Vaccinations
## Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine

 Select 
   deaths.continent, 
   deaths.location, 
   deaths.date, 
   deaths.population, 
   vaccines.new_vaccinations, 
   SUM(CAST(vaccines.new_vaccinations AS int64)) OVER (Partition by deaths.Location Order by deaths.location, deaths.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
 --, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population)*100
 From `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths` deaths
 Join `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_vaccinations` vaccines
 	On deaths.location = vaccines.location
 	and deaths.date = vaccines.date
 where deaths.continent is not null 
 order by deaths.location,
   deaths.date


##Using CTE

With PopulationvsVaccines ( continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
as(
  Select 
  deaths.continent, 
  deaths.location, 
  deaths.date, 
  deaths.population, 
  vaccines.new_vaccinations, 
  SUM(CAST(vaccines.new_vaccinations AS int64)) OVER (Partition by deaths.Location Order by deaths.location, deaths.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
--, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population)*100
From `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_deaths` deaths
Join `portfolioproject-353619.covid_info.covid_vaccinations` vaccines
	On deaths.location = vaccines.location
	and deaths.date = vaccines.date
where deaths.continent is not null 
--order by deaths.location,
  --deaths.date
